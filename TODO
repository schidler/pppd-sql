Features and functionality which should be added in the future.

    * Well no real feature but needs to be done. Testing, testing and
      more testing. Maybe there exist unknown bugs. :)

    * Add support for other database backends. (Firebird/InterBase,
      Ingres and SQLite)

Look at the AUTHORS file if you want help me with 'pppd-sql', or
if you have other interesting features which should be added.
