Introduction
============

'pppd-sql' is a plugin for the Point-to-Point server (pppd) on Linux
and Solaris which adds an authentication backend using a MySQL or
PostgreSQL database for Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol
(CHAP) and Password Authentication Protocol (PAP). It supports
MS-CHAPv1 and MS-CHAPv2 too. The IPCP negotiation after authentication
handshake is also supported.

'pppd-sql' supports a flexible configuration scheme, has concurrent
connection handling for one single user across multiple tunnel servers
and comes with easy and handy documentation.

'pppd-sql' is based on some parts of 'pppd-mysql' which is a good tool
to see how pppd can work with mysql, but lacks flexible configuration
functionality.

Why another "new" sql plugin for pppd?
======================================

Well the 'pppd-mysql' plugin looks unmaintained now since three years
(last release is from september 2005) and for my employer the
PlusServer AG, I was seeking for a common way to integrate poptop
with ppp and MySQL. Also there was no PostgreSQL plugin available
until 'pppd-sql' and I want to change this.

Why another "way" of adding sql support for pppd?
=================================================

There exist at least two other ways doing this: First using freeradius
with radiusclient-ng via pppd-radius plugin and second NTLM with Samba
via pppd-winbind plugin. Both solutions creates to much overhead for me,
single points of failures and are heavy to debug.

Manual

It is a good idea to read the `FAQ' file.
